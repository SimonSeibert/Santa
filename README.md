# Santa (Present Delivery)

A small game [which is also available on itch.io](https://mrschmorington.itch.io/present-delivery). <br/>
There you can also find a free .apk file for android or play it inside a browser alternatively. <br/>

It's *christmas night* and about 2.2 billion presents need to be delivered to children all over the world! <br/>
As expected your job as santa is to throw the correct presents into the chimneys. But watch out, as dawn nears you get faster and faster! <br/>

You can try to improve your records, which can be viewed locally. <br/>

Known Bugs: <br/>
- Better not play the game on a lower resolution than 720p or some screen elements will go off-screen <br/>
- Buttons are bugged when you play on some smartphone browsers (e.g. Firefox, but Chrome does seem to work) for some reason (WebGL doesn't seem to like mobile browsers) <br/>
- Also I'm very sorry for the "How to play"-Screen <br/>

This game was created with the goal of finally finishing a project. <br/>
I hope you have a bit of fun and don't get too frustrated! :) <br/>

Feedback is always welcome! <br/>
